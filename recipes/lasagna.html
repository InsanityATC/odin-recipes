    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 2</strong>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 3</strong>
    <p>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, onions, and garlic and cook until onions are tender; drain excess liquid and cool. </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 4</strong>
    <p>At the same time, bring a small pot of water to a boil; add spinach and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain and cool slightly; squeeze out any excess liquid and finely chop. </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 5</strong>
    <p>Combine ricotta cheese, Romano cheese, egg, salt, oregano, basil, and pepper in a bowl. Add cooled mushroom mixture and spinach; beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 1 minute. </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 6</strong>
    <p>Lay 5 lasagna noodles in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta-spinach mixture over noodles, then sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Spread 1 cup pasta sauce over top. Repeat layers two more times, then cover with aluminum foil. </p>
    <br>
