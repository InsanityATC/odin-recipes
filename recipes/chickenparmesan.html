    <h1>Chicken Parmesan Recipe</h1>
    <img src="images/chickenparmesan.jpg" alt="Chicken Parmesan">
    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
    <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
    <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <p>Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick. </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 2</strong>
    <p>Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs. </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 3</strong>
    <p>Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor. </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 4</strong>
    <p>Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast. </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 5</strong>
    <p>THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese? </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 6</strong>
    <p>Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go. </p>
